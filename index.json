This is true in many domains, stretching from scientific to government documents. In fact, surrounding text in these articles are often statements summarizing or highlighting some information derived from the primary source data in tables. Describing all the information provided in a table in a readable manner would be lengthy and considerably more difficult to understand.\nRecently, there has been an interest in factual verification and prediction over structured data like tables and graphs. To circumvent any false news incident, it is necessary to not only model and predict over structured data efficiently but also to explain those predictions. In this paper, as part of the SemEval-2021 Task 9, we tackle the problem of fact verification and evidence finding over tabular data.\nThere are two subtasks. Given a table and a statement/fact, subtask A determines whether the statement is inferred from the tabular data, and subtask B determines which cells in the table provide evidence for the former subtask. We make a comparison of the baselines and state-of-the-art approaches over the given SemTabFact dataset. We also propose a novel approach CellBERT to solve evidence finding as a form of the Natural Language Inference task. We obtain a 3-way F1 score of 0.69 on subtask A and an F1 score of 0.65 on subtask B. We were 5th in Subtask A and 1st in Subtask B\n","date":1614729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614729600,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://jaihonikhil.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2021-03-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"SemEval Task 9","tags":["Natural Language Processing"],"title":"Statement Verification and Evidence Finding using Tables","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jaya Srivastava"],"categories":["Just Beginning"],"content":"Salut!‚ï∞(* ¬∞‚ñΩ¬∞ *)‚ïØ\nDisclaimer: This is a personal blog written for the sole purpose of the satisfaction of talking to someone in a way that the writer finds satisfying. In addition to it do not try to interpret the emogis in the blog üçï\nI have always wanted to be an original and the thought of writing or documenting things has always excited me. Besides Blogging, I have always wanted to cover songs and post them for my own satisfaction. But somehow couldn\u0026rsquo;t because of my own insecurities, the people around me, and the thought that publicizing oneself was a cheap stunt. (I\u0026rsquo;m wrong here)\nHowever, somehow I realized in the past year that my life is short, I have sooo many dreams to accomplish, soo many amazing people to meet and sooo much help to give. I have always loved meeting new people, getting to know them, and mainly how differently everyone thinks!\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to sit here and wait for things to happen, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make them happen, and if people think I\u0026rsquo;m an idiot I don\u0026rsquo;t care.\nSo considering everything, if I have 50‚Äì60ish more years to live and so many dreams to achieve, I need to be alive and not just living.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know how my blogs are gonna turn out or even if they would even matter to anyone. But does it even matter when you are just an amateur open to ideas, risks, and suggestions(HINT HINT)‚ùó\nOHKAY Jaya Speak the Truth!!üåä\nWell, I like talking and why not? and I have these so many wonderful ideas, thoughts, and experiences in my head and while I am exploring so many things at this stage, I can\u0026rsquo;t contain everything in my head without venting it out anywhere. So this blog is possibly an effort to pour my heart out, speak my mind and hear my thoughts. Also in a way, helping me to think clearly and taking control of my thoughts or rather they taking control over me‚ùì\nThough I am mainly writing to deal with anxiety, guilt, and self-hatred. I have been feeling miserable, wrongly done, hurt, and lost for a while.\nThe desire for answers and conquest over anxiety and mental issues, paired with an inability to never being able to overcome or find the source, control, and understanding of the problem has eventually led me to start finding things that are beautiful about me and appreciating the world around. I am trying to reason and understand how to overcome because I can\u0026rsquo;t give up.\nIt isn\u0026rsquo;t the fact that you are hurt that counts,\nBut only How did you take it?\nWell in addition to it who knows I might meet amazing people with similar thoughts and make new friends!üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\nAlso, I am just beginning so if you are reading this blog, you will notice the improvement in the content and mentality gradually so please be patient with me.

As a result, We implemented a new heuristics added to our pathfinding visualizer by the name of Optimized Manhatten. Having tested the heuristic on benchmark, we have managed time reduction by approx 50% in case of Astar algorithm and approx 15% reduction in time in Best First Search.\nThe length of path and number of operations remain unaltered, hence we have not applied greedy algorithm to reduce time and compromise on the optimal path. We have also added an option of speed in the naivigation bar, the speed with which the rover reaches the space station can be managed.\nGateway Heuristic\nThe maze and patterns present in the repository were added to test a new heuristic called the Gateway heuristic. The gateway heuristic pre-calculates the distances between entrances/exits of the areas. It also proceeds in two phases. Preprocessing Phase: The map is decomposed into areas in an identical way as for the dead-end heuristic.\nWe define the boundaries between areas as gateways (or gates). A gateway can be of an arbitrary size, but an artifact of our decomposition algorithm is that its orientation is always either horizontal or vertical. Next we use multiple A* searches to pre-calculate the (static) distance between gates. For each gateway we calculate the path distance to all the other gateways (cost of infinity if no path exists). Alternatively, one could calculate only the distances between gateways within each room and then use a small search to accumulate the total cost during run-time. However, our approach results in more accurate heuristic estimates and faster run-time access.\n","date":1591142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591142400,"objectID":"1551ce708e26625310deb3a4c3e3ffec","permalink":"https://jaihonikhil.github.io/project/example2/","publishdate":"2020-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example2/","section":"project","summary":"Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program","tags":["Path Planning"],"title":"Navigate the Mars Rover (The Mars Colonization Program)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588464000,"objectID":"aa43c3e04985c87ca6a2f053af823c04","permalink":"https://jaihonikhil.github.io/project/studentbuild/","publishdate":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/studentbuild/","section":"project","summary":"Winner","tags":["Healthcare","Chatbot","Pitching","Start-up"],"title":"STUDENTBUILD4COVID19 International Hackathon (USA) Teamc- RapiDoc+","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"TADT is a robust autonomous disinfection tunnel to disinfect external surfaces of COVID-19 virus such as clothes and open body sections in public places such as airports, office complexes, schools, and malls.

Combined with the extreme lack of medical practitioners and infrastructure in rural areas, the lack of screening programs, which would provide such timely diagnosis, has made pulmonary diseases the second most deadliest kind in India. To make such screening programs more practical and feasible, we propose an automated procedure for the screening of the rural populations, using an easy-to-use device that can be operated even by a community worker. As a proof of concept, we have developed a novel device to record auscultation sounds and the breathing rate of the patient. On this data, a machine learning model with Keras framework and Tensorflow backend is implemented to detect abnormalities.\nA 3 dense layer and a dropout layer convolutional neural network is used to identify Wheezes and Crackles in an audio file which is fed as Mel-Spectrograms as inputs. Data augmentation was employed in the form of audio stretching as well as Vocal Tract Length Perturbation, especially for the scarcer \u0026lsquo;wheeze\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;wheeze and crackles\u0026rsquo; classes.

Such automation using an inexpensive device removes the dependency on doctors and expensive equipment, which makes the screening programs impractical for large scale implementation today.\nWe were awarded silver medal in this competition !\n","date":1575331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575331200,"objectID":"20bcb2db83254db10b404ce1360b4c6c","permalink":"https://jaihonikhil.github.io/project/proejct3/","publishdate":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/proejct3/","section":"project","summary":"Silver Medal in Inter IIT Techmeet","tags":["Healthcare","Machine Learning","Pitching","Start-up"],"title":"Preliminary Detection of Pulmonary Diseases","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Solution Concept NIR Analysis and Pulse Oximetry\nPitched the Business model for BETiC- Non Invasive Glucometer depicting market size, penetration rate, profit and estimated sales revenue\nNovelty NIR Analysis along with Pulse Oximetry with multi-variable regression solve the purpose\nBenefits One-step, easy to follow procedure Useful for patients with high, low as well as normal sugar values No risk of spread of viral agents Cost-effective solution in the long run\nCompetitive advantage A one-time-buy product that gives accurate results throughout its lifetime Multiple people can use the same device, hence it is cost-effective Only needs change of batteries with time\n","date":1567468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567468800,"objectID":"2c104857c9a9bbfbd572b995d2794861","permalink":"https://jaihonikhil.github.io/project/pitch/","publishdate":"2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pitch/","section":"project","summary":"Runner Up, Pitch Prime (E‚ÄôSummit‚Äô19, IIT Kanpur)","tags":["Pitching","Healthcare"],"title":"Non Invasive Glucometer","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

It works even if the person is occluded from the WiTrack device or in a different room. WiTrack does not require the user to wear any kind of wearable device. It transmits wireless signals whose power is significantly lower than Wi-Fi or cellular transmissions. It can be incorporated into consumer electronics and has a wide set of applications.\nThe device transmits a radio signal and uses its reflections to estimate the time it takes the signal to travel from the transmitting antenna to the reflecting object and back to each of the receiving antennas. WiTrack then uses its knowledge of the position of the antennas to create a geometric reference model, which maps the round trip delays observed by the receive antennas to a 3D position of the reflecting body.\nFor this Project, our team and the project was awareded the Best Research and Development Award by the Science and Technology Council, IIT Kanpur.\nThis Project was inspired by the Witrack Project of MIT under Professor Dina Katabi.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3cf5969cdfe6544f95314ed174320b0a","permalink":"https://jaihonikhil.github.io/project/project2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project2/","section":"project","summary":"Prof. A.R Harish, Department of Electrical Engineering, IITK","tags":["Signal Processing","Wireless Tracking"],"title":"WITRACK Wireless tracking of humans through wal","type":"project"}]
