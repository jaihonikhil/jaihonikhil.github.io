      <title>Techno Advanced Disinfection Tunnel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TADT is a robust autonomous disinfection tunnel to disinfect external surfaces of COVID-19 virus such as clothes and open body sections in public places such as airports, office complexes, schools, and malls. To make the tunnel effective and highly efficient, it has been provided with two chambers with three disinfection processes. Due to the multiple processes, the possibility of neutralizing the virus is quite high and higher than other solutions available at this point for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chamber 1 sprays the solution of a disinfectant on the person. This solution can be either a dilute solution of approved chemical or any Ayurvedic/herbal disinfectant. Once the person enters chamber 2, he/she is exposed to hot air at 70 °C along with far-ultraviolet C rays (207–222 nm). Both chambers function autonomously by detecting a person in a chamber using ultrasonic sensors. The proposed tunnel is developed under industry–academia collaboration jointly by Technopark@iitk and ALIMCO under the ambit of the Ministry of Human Resources Development and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, respectively. The tunnel is referred to as the ‘Techno Advanced Disinfection Tunnel’ (TADT).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preliminary Detection of Pulmonary Diseases</title>
      <link>https://jaihonikhil.github.io/project/proejct3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Early detection of Pulmonary diseases like Aastma, Tuberculosis, COPD ,Bronchiolitis etc through non-invasive method. This project was done keeping in mind a competition &amp;ldquo;Tech For Change&amp;rdquo; in Inter IIT Techmeet 2019 in IIT Rorkee.The slides presented are attached as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the fatalities caused by pulmonary disorders such as COPD, asthma, bronchiolitis etc. could be prevented by timely diagnosis of the patients. Combined with the extreme lack of medical practitioners and infrastructure in rural areas, the lack of screening programs, which would provide such timely diagnosis, has made pulmonary diseases the second most deadliest kind in India. To make such screening programs more practical and feasible, we propose an automated procedure for the screening of the rural populations, using an easy-to-use device that can be operated even by a community worker. As a proof of concept, we have developed a novel device to record auscultation sounds and the breathing rate of the patient. On this data, a machine learning model with Keras framework and Tensorflow backend is implemented to detect abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3 dense layer and a dropout layer convolutional neural network is used to identify Wheezes and Crackles in an audio file which is fed as Mel-Spectrograms as inputs. Data augmentation was employed in the form of audio stretching as well as Vocal Tract Length Perturbation, especially for the scarcer &amp;lsquo;wheeze&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;wheeze and crackles&amp;rsquo; classes. Overall validation accuracy currently stands at roughly 80 percent. On the user interface side, the mobile application displays an immediate report of the patient displaying the diseases which are suggested by the symptoms observed. Such automation using an inexpensive device removes the dependency on doctors and expensive equipment, which makes the screening programs impractical for large scale implementation today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were awarded silver medal in this competition !&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution Concept&lt;/strong&gt;
NIR Analysis and Pulse Oximetry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitched the Business model for BETiC- Non Invasive Glucometer depicting market size, penetration rate, profit and estimated sales revenue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novelty&lt;/strong&gt;
NIR Analysis along with Pulse Oximetry with multi-variable regression solve the purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;
One-step, easy to follow procedure
Useful for patients with high, low as well as normal sugar values
No risk of spread of viral agents
Cost-effective solution in the long run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;
A one-time-buy product that gives accurate results throughout its lifetime
Multiple people can use the same device, hence it is cost-effective
Only needs change of batteries with time&lt;/p&gt;
